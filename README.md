# Restaurant-Location-Recommendation-System
The objective of my work is to build a model that will recommend at which location one can build restaurants so that profit can be maximized according to demand.I have taken the dataset "Zomato Bangalore Restaurants" fromÂ Kaggle.
The model asks the user to input things like what type of restaurant they are planning to make (e.g. Cafe, Casual Dining, dessert parlour etc.), type of dish, the cuisines etc. Finally, the model will recommend the user the best location for the restaurant to fit in. Different machine learning models were used to improve the accuracy.
